Audio playing doorbell with MSP430 launchpad. 

This project (done on a msp430 launchpad) uses a speaker on PIN 1.2 and the button on PIN 1.3. Filters (or at least a capacitor) are recommended as there is DC offset and high freq pwm on the output, but it is not required if you just attach a small speaker to the LP.

Usage (with your own audio):

First find or create an 8Khz unsigned 8bit raw mono audio file (without headers or they'll become part of your data) that will fit the flash of your MCU (under 2 sec). You can use Audacity (+ google) for this task.

Then we create an unsigned char array named binary_data[] containing the audio data into a .h file. For this you can use the following command if you're using linux (where fool.raw is the binary file and binary_data.h is the output file):

$ (echo "const unsigned char binary_data[] = {"; od -txC fool.raw | sed -e "s/^[0-9]*//" -e s"/ \([0-9a-f][09a-f]\)/0x\1,/g" -e"\$d" | sed -e"\$s/,$/};/") >binary_data.h

When this is done you have a .h file you can include in your program.


Enjoy,
E.B.
